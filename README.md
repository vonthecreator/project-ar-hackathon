# Project Ar Hackathon


## SEC #1  --> // Description, Examples & Objective

#### WHAT: A repository for arweave hackathon {https://is.gd/auyDRe} 
> ** A Solutions that uses most if not all the bouties that are being asked 
to complete as a part of the Arweave hackathon. The goal being to maximize
on the value we accumilate from pricez and the application features themselves...**

### Exmples:
- A tokenized-photo-sharing application where: user-credentials (kwill), uploaded-content (arweave objects, via Bundlr) & transaction-records (local --> kwil), 
- adding more soon...


#### Breakdown of app architecure and project layout
*  DATA <-> LOGIC <-> INTERFACE 
> Most web-apps repeat this pattern; (web2/3)). Method of construction: Decoupling data + interface & logic to reduce dev time --> assemble the entire project in modular way:>(speed + simplicity). Why this way? To minimize clutter from details that may be redundant or affect how fast we build/comprehend a subject/scope of any mattert.

## SEC #2 --> // Technical details & Implementation strategy

### Design specs
* Monospace + Sans-serif font --> {IBM Plex Mono + Arial/Arial-black}
* Lots of White-space --> minimal + elegance
* Dual-tone --> { black & white }
* >>> The goal is to focus on key features that make unsplash great (minimalistic & ease-of-use <color,structure & layout>)

### Implementation Playbook
- [] Upload raw (images) object via bundlr (speed + standadization)
- [] User accounts via kwill
- [] Othent for auth-login process 
- [] ArConnect wallet links all decentralized assets that make the APP {Users, Content, Transactions}
- [] adding more soon...


### Acronyms & distincitons (meaning-of-things)
* Transactions => all activity happening on the app <use ArNS to map activity>
* Users => record of all valid wallets registered on the app as active accounts 
* Content => What we are here for <content can be incentivised [ArNS:listen for trigger -> process wallet-2-wallet transactions]> 


## SEC #3 --> //Intent & Non-logical 

*** a modular tokenized-photo-sharing app with security and simplicity in mind + goal of permanancy >>> your work deserves a spotlight!.***
